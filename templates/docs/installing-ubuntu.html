<p>Once a node has been accepted into MAAS and is ready for use, users can
deploy services to that node.</p>
<p>Prior to deployment, MAAS is responsible for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Powering up the node.</li>
<li>Installing Ubuntu on the node.</li>
<li>Installing the user’s SSH keys on the node.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once these steps have been completed, the node is ready to have services
deployed to it, either manually or by using a tool like
<a href="http://juju.ubuntu.com">Juju</a>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to install Ubuntu on a node:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#debian-installer"><em>The Debian installer</em></a>.</li>
<li><a href="#fast-installer"><em>The fast installer</em></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-debian-installer">The Debian Installer<a class="anchor" href="#the-debian-installer"></a></h2>
<p>The Debian Installer installs Ubuntu on a node in exactly the same way
as you would install it manually: using the <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">Debian
Installer</a>. Answers to
the questions asked by the installer are provided in a ‘preseed’ file.
For more information on preseed files, see the <a href="configure.html#preseed"><em>Additional
Configuration</em></a> page.</p>
<p>The Debian installer is not enabled by default. To enable it for a node
that’s been configured to use the fast installer, visit the node’s page
as an administrator and click the <code class="docutils
.literal">Use the Debian installer</code> button.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/node-page-use-default-installer.png" /></p>
<p>To set multiple nodes to use the Debian installer, select the
<code>Mark nodes as using the Debian installer</code> option
from the bulk action menu on the <code>Nodes</code> page in the
MAAS web UI.</p>
<p>Because it installs Ubuntu from scratch, downloading packages as
required, the Debian installer is slower than the <a href="#fast-installer"><em>fast
installer</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-fast-installer">The fast installer<a class="anchor" href="#the-fast-installer"></a></h2>
<p>The fast installer is, as the name suggests, a means of installing
Ubuntu on a node more quickly than would be possible using the <a href="#debian-installer">Debian
installer</a>.</p>
<p>The fast installer is enabled by default for newly enlisted nodes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/node-page-use-fast-installer.png" /></p>
<p>To set multiple nodes to use the fast installer, select the
<code>Mark nodes as using the fast installer</code> option from
the bulk action menu on the <code>Nodes</code> page in the MAAS
web UI.</p>
<p>The fast installer copies a pre-built Ubuntu image to the node, with all
the packages installed that would be normally found in an Ubuntu
installation.</p>
<p>The fast installer is much quicker than the Debian installer, but has
the disadvantage that it’s less easy to configure a node at install
time, since the fast installer doesn’t use a 
<a href="configure.html#preseed">preseed file</a>. In addition, the packages that are
initially installed on a fast-installed node need updating manually,
since they are part of the installation image and not downloaded fresh
from an apt repository.</p>
