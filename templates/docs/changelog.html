<p>New CentOS Release support.<br />
Further to the work done in the 1.7.0 MAAS Release, MAAS now supports uploading various versions of CentOS. Previously MAAS would only officially support 6.5.</p>
<p>Power Monitoring for Seamicro 15000, Cisco UCS and HP Moonshot Chassis<br />
Further the work done in the 1.7.0 MAAS release, it now supports power query and monitoring for the Seamicro 15000 Chassis, the Cisco UCS Chassis Manager and the HP Moonshot Chassis Manager.</p>
<p>Node Listing Page and Node Event Log live refresh<br />
The Node Listing page and the Node Event Log now have live refresh every 10 seconds. This allows MAAS to display the latest node status and events without forcing a browser refresh.</p>
<p>IP Address Reservation<br />
The static IP address reservation API now has an optional "mac" parameter. Specifying a MAC address here will link the new static IP to that MAC address. A DHCP host map will be created for the MAC address. No other IPs may be reserved for that MAC address until the current one is released.</p>

<p><strong>Re-import your boot images</strong><br />
You must re-import your boot images, see below for details.</p>
<p><strong>Update Curtin preseed files</strong><br />
Two changes were made to Curtin preseed files that need your attention if you made any customisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The OS name must now appear in the filename. The new schema is shown here, each file pattern is tried in turn until a match is found:</p>
<p>{prefix}_{osystem}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}_{release}_{node_name} {prefix}_{osystem}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}_{release} {prefix}_{osystem}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch} {prefix}_{osystem}_{node_arch} {prefix}_{osystem} {prefix}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are modifying <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> in the preseed, it must be moved so it is processed last in <code>late_commands</code> since MAAS now writes to this file itself as part of IPv6 setup. For example:</p>
<pre><code>late_commands:
  bonding_02: ["curtin", "in-target", "--", "wget", "-O", "/etc/network/interfaces", "http://[...snip...]"]
</code></pre>
<p>must now look like this:</p>
<pre><code>late_commands:
  zz_write_ifaces: ["curtin", "in-target", "--", "wget", "-O", "/etc/network/interfaces", "http://[...snip...]"]
</code></pre>
<p>The leading <code>zz</code> ensures the command sorts to the end of the <code>late_commands</code> list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="major-new-features">Major new features<a class="anchor" href="#major-new-features"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Improved image downloading and reporting.</strong><br />
MAAS boot images are now downloaded centrally by the region controller and disseminated to all registered cluster controllers. This change includes a new web UI under the Images tab that allows the admin to select which images to import and shows the progress of the ongoing download. This completely replaces any file-based configuration that used to take place on cluster controllers. The cluster page now shows whether it has synchronised all the images from the region controller.</p>
<p>This process is also completely controllable using the API.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately due to a format change in the way images are stored, it was not possible to migrate previously downloaded images to the new region storage. The cluster(s) will still be able to use the existing images, however the region controller will be unaware of them until an import is initiated. When the import is finished, the cluster(s) will remove older image resources.</p>
<p>This means that the first thing to do after upgrading to 1.7 is go to the Images tab and re-import the images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Increased robustness.</strong><br />
A large amount of effort has been given to ensuring that MAAS remains robust in the face of adversity. An updated node state model has been implemented that takes into account more of the situations in which a node can be found including any failures at each stage.</p>
<p>When a node is getting deployed, it is now monitored to check that each stage is reached in a timely fashion; if it does not then it is marked as failed.</p>
<p>The core power driver was updated to check the state of the power on each node and is reported in the web UI and API. The core driver now also handles retries when changing the power state of hardware, removing the requirement that each power template handle it individually.</p>
<p><strong>RPC security.</strong><br />
As a step towards mutually verified TLS connections between MAAS's components, 1.7 introduces a simple shared-secret mechanism to authenticate the region with the clusters and vice-versa. For those clusters that run on the same machine as the region controller (which will account for most people), everything will continue to work without intervention. However, if you're running a cluster on a separate machine, you must install the secret:</p>
<ol>
<li>After upgrading the region controller, view /var/lib/maas/secret (it's text) and copy it.</li>
<li>
<p>On each cluster, run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -u maas maas-provision install-shared-secret</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll be prompted for the secret; paste it in and press enter. It is a password prompt, so the secret will not be echoed back to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it; the upgraded cluster controller will find the secret without needing to be told.</p>
<p><strong>RPC connections.</strong><br />
Each cluster maintains a persistent connection to each region controller process that's running. The ports on which the region is listening are all high-numbered, and they are allocated randomly by the OS. In a future release of MAAS we will narrow this down. For now, each cluster controller needs unfiltered access to each machine in the region on all high-numbered TCP ports.</p>
<p><strong>Node event log.</strong><br />
For every major event on nodes, it is now logged in a node-specific log. This includes events such as power changes, deployments and any failures.</p>
<p><strong>IPv6.</strong><br />
It is now possible to deploy Ubuntu nodes that have IPv6 enabled. See ipv6 for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of Celery and RabbitMQ.</strong><br />
While Celery was found to be very reliable it ultimately did not suit the project's requirements as it is a largely fire-and-forget mechanism. Additionally it was another moving part that caused some headaches for users and admins alike, so the decision was taken to remove it and implement a custom communications mechanism between the region controller and cluster controllers. The new mechanism is bidirectional and allowed the complex interactions to take place that are required as part of the robustness improvements.</p>
<p>Since a constant connection is maintained, as a side effect the web UI now shows whether each cluster is connected or not.</p>
<p><strong>Support for other OSes.</strong><br />
Non-Ubuntu OSes are fully supported now. This includes:<br />
-   Windows
-   Centos
-   SuSE</p>
<p><strong>Custom Images.</strong><br />
MAAS now supports the deployment of Custom Images. Custom images can be uploaded via the API. The usage of custom images allows the deployment of other Ubuntu Flavors, such as Ubuntu Desktop.</p>
<p><strong>maas-proxy.</strong><br />
MAAS now uses maas-proxy as the default proxy solution instead of squid-deb-proxy. On a fresh install, MAAS will use maas-proxy by default. On upgrades from previous releases, MAAS will install maas-proxy instead of squid-deb-proxy.</p>
<h3 id="minor-notable-changes">Minor notable changes<a class="anchor" href="#minor-notable-changes"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Better handling of networks.</strong><br />
All networks referred to by cluster interfaces are now automatically registered on the Network page. Any node network interfaces are automatically linked to the relevant Network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>
<p>Commissioning currently requires an IP address to be available for each network interface on a network that MAAS manages; this allows MAAS to auto-populate its networks database. In general you should use a well-sized network (/16 recommended if you will be using containers and VMs) and dynamic pool. If this feature risks causing IP exhaustion for your deployment and you do not need the auto-populate functionality, you can disable it by running the following command on your region controller:</p>
<pre><code>sudo maas &lt;profile&gt; maas set-config name=enable_dhcp_discovery_on_unconfigured_interfaces value=False
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Improved logging.</strong><br />
A total overhaul of where logging is produced was undertaken, and now all the main events in MAAS are selectively reported to syslog with the "maas" prefix from both the region and cluster controllers alike. If MAAS is installed using the standard Ubuntu packaging, its syslog entries are redirected to /var/log/maas/maas.log.</p>
<p>On the clusters, pserv.log is now less chatty and contains only errors. On the region controller appservers, maas-django.log contains only appserver errors.</p>
<p><strong>Static IP selection.</strong><br />
The API was extended so that specific IPs can be pre-allocated for network interfaces on nodes and for user-allocated IPs.</p>
<p><strong>Pronounceable random hostnames.</strong><br />
The old auto-generated 5-letter names were replaced with a pseudo-random name that is produced from a dictionary giving names of the form 'adjective-noun'.</p>
<h3 id="known-problems-&amp;-workarounds">Known Problems &amp; Workarounds<a class="anchor" href="#known-problems-&amp;-workarounds"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Upgrade issues</strong><br />
There may be upgrade issues for users currently on MAAS 1.5 and 1.6; while we have attempted to reproduce and address all the issues reported, some bugs remain inconclusive. We recommend a full, tested backup of the MAAS servers before attempting the upgrade to 1.7. If you do encounter issues, please file these and flag them to the attention of the MAAS team and we will address them in point-releases. See bugs <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1381058">1381058</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1382266">1382266</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379890">1379890</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379532">1379532</a>, and <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379144">1379144</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Split Region/Cluster set-ups</strong><br />
If you site your cluster on a separate host to the region, it needs a security key to be manually installed by running <code>maas-provision install-shared-secret</code> on the cluster host.</p>
<p><strong>Private boot streams</strong><br />
If you had private boot image stream information configured in MAAS 1.5 or 1.6, upgrading to 1.7 will not take that into account and it will need to be manually entered on the settings page in the MAAS UI (bug <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379890">1379890</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Concurrency issues</strong><br />
Concurrency issues expose us to races when simultaneous operations are triggered. This is the source of many hard to reproduce issues which will require us to change the default database isolation level. We intend to address this in the first point release of 1.7.</p>
<p><strong>Destroying a Juju environment</strong><br />
When attempting to "juju destroy" an environment, nodes must be in the DEPLOYED state; otherwise, the destroy will fail. You should wait for all in-progress actions on the MAAS cluster to conclude before issuing the command. (bug <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1381619">1381619</a>)</p>
<p><strong>AMT power control</strong><br />
A few AMT-related issues remain, with workarounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Commissioning NUC reboots instead of shutting down (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1368685">1368685</a>). There is <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1368685/comments/8">a workaround in the power template</a></li>
<li>MAAS (amttool) cannot control AMT version > 8. See <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1331214/comments/18">workaround described in bug 1331214</a></li>
<li>AMT NUC stuck at boot prompt instead of powering down (no ACPI support in syslinux poweroff) (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1376716">1376716</a>). See the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1376716/comments/12">ACPI-only workaround</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Disk wiping</strong><br />
If you enable disk wiping, juju destroy-environment may fail for you. The current workaround is to wait and re-issue the command. This will be fixed in future versions of MAAS &amp; Juju. (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1386327">1386327</a>)</p>
<p><strong>BIND with DNSSEC</strong><br />
If you are using BIND with a forwarder that uses DNSSEC and have not configured certificates, you will need to explicitly disable that feature in your BIND configuration (1384334)</p>
<p><strong>Boot source selections on the API</strong><br />
Use of API to change image selections can leave DB in a bad state (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1376812">1376812</a>). It can be fixed by issuing direct database updates.</p>
<p><strong>Disabling DNS</strong><br />
Disabling DNS may not work (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1383768">1383768</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Stale DNS zone files</strong><br />
Stale DNS zone files may be left behind if the MAAS domainname is changed (bug <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1383329">1383329</a>)</p>

<p>Special notice:<br />
Cluster interfaces now have static IP ranges in order to give nodes stable IP addresses. You need to set the range in each interface to turn on this feature. See below for details.</p>
<h3 id="major-new-features">Major new features<a class="anchor" href="#major-new-features"></a></h3>
<p>IP addresses overhaul.<br />
This release contains a total reworking of IP address allocation. You can now define a separate "static" range in each cluster interface configuration that is separate from the DHCP server's dynamic range. Any node in use by a user will receive an IP address from the static range that is guaranteed not to change during its allocated lifetime. Previously, this was at the whim of the DHCP server despite MAAS placing host maps in its configuration.</p>
<p>Currently, dynamic IP addresses will continue to receive DNS entries so as to maintain backward compatibility with installations being upgraded from 1.5. However, this will be changed in a future release to only give DNS entries to static IPs.</p>
<p>You can also use the API to <a href="http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.6/api.html#ip-addresses">reserve IP addresses</a> on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>Support for additional OSes.<br />
MAAS can now install operating systems other than Ubuntu on nodes. Preliminary beta support exists for CentOS and SuSE via the <a href="https://launchpad.net/curtin">Curtin</a> "fast" installer. This has not been thoroughly tested yet and has been provided in case anyone finds this useful and is willing to help find and report bugs.</p>
<h3 id="minor-notable-changes">Minor notable changes<a class="anchor" href="#minor-notable-changes"></a></h3>
<p>DNS entries<br />
In 1.5 DNS entries for nodes were a CNAME record. As of 1.6, they are now all "A" records, which allows for reliable reverse look-ups.</p>
<p>Only nodes that are allocated to a user and started will receive "A" record entries. Unallocated nodes no longer have DNS entries.</p>
<p>Removal of bootresources.yaml<br />
The bootresources.yaml file, which had to be configured separately on each cluster controller, is no longer in use. Instead, the configuration for which images to download is now held by the region controller, and defaults to downloading all images for LTS releases. A <a href="http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.6/api.html#boot-source">rudimentary API</a> is available to manipulate this configuration.</p>
<p>Fast installer is now the default<br />
Prevously, the slower Debian installer was used by default. Any newly-enlisted nodes will now use the newer <a href="https://launchpad.net/curtin">fast installer</a>. Existing nodes will keep the installer setting that they already have.</p>

<p>Boot resource download changes.<br />
Further to the work done in the 1.5 (Ubuntu 14.04) release, MAAS no longer stores the configuration for downloading boot resources in <code>/etc/maas/bootresources.yaml</code>; this file is now obsolete. The sources list is now stored on the region controller and passed to the cluster controller when the job to download boot resources is started. It is still possible to pass a list of sources to <code>maas-import-pxe-files</code> when running the script manually.</p>

<p>(released in Ubuntu 14.04)</p>
<h3 id="major-new-features">Major new features<a class="anchor" href="#major-new-features"></a></h3>
<p>Advanced Networking.<br />
MAAS will now support multiple managed network interfaces on a single cluster. It will track networks (including tagged VLANs) to which each node is able to connect and provides this information in the API. API clients may also use networking information in acquisition constraints when asking for a new node allocation.</p>
<p>See The full Networking documentation \&lt;networks>.</p>
<p>Zones.<br />
A Zone is an arbitrary grouping of nodes. MAAS now allows admins to define Zones, and place in them any of the region's nodes. Once defined, API clients can use the zone name as acquisition constraints for new node allocations.</p>
<p>See physical-zones for more detail.</p>
<p>Hardware Enablement Kernels.<br />
MAAS is now able to fetch and use hardware enablement kernels which allow kernels for newer Ubuntu releases to be used on older releases.</p>
<p>See hardware-enablement-kernels</p>
<h3 id="minor-feature-changes">Minor feature changes<a class="anchor" href="#minor-feature-changes"></a></h3>
<p>Maas-Test.<br />
A new project <a href="https://launchpad.net/maas-test/">maas-test</a> was created to put a piece of hardware through MAAS's test suite to see if it's suitable for use in MAAS, and optionally report the results to a bug in Launchpad's maas-test project.</p>
<p>IPMI improvements.<br />
Many improvements were made to IPMI handling, including better detection during enlistment. Many IPMI-based systems that previously failed to work with MAAS will now work correctly.</p>
<p>Completion of image downloading changes.<br />
Further to the work done in the 1.4 (Ubuntu 13.10) release, MAAS now uses indexed "simplestreams" data published by Canonical to fetch not only the ephemeral images, but now also the kernels and ramdisks. The resource download configuration is now in a new file <code>/etc/maas/bootresources.yaml</code> on each cluster controller. All previous configuration files for image downloads are now obsolete. The new file will be pre-configured based on images that are already present on the cluster.</p>
<p>This change also enables end-users to provide their own simplestreams data and thusly their own custom images.</p>
<p>Cluster-driven hardware availability.<br />
When adding or editing node hardware in the region controller, MAAS will contact the relevant cluster controller to validate the node's settings. As of release, the only validation made is the architecture and the power settings. Available architectures are based on which images have been imported on the cluster. In the future, this will enable new cluster controllers to be added that contain drivers for new hardware without restarting the region controller.</p>
<p>Seamicro hardware.<br />
MAAS now supports the Seamicro 15000 hardware for power control and API-based enlistment.</p>
<p>AMT.<br />
MAAS now supports power control using <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology.html">Intel AMT</a>.</p>
<p>DNS forwarders.<br />
In MAAS's settings it's now possible to configure an upstream DNS, which will be set in the bind daemon's 'forwarders' option.</p>
<p>Foreign DHCP servers.<br />
MAAS detects and shows you if any other DHCP servers are active on the networks that are on the cluster controller.</p>
<p>Commissioning Results.<br />
A node's commissioning results are now shown in the UI.</p>
<p>Renamed commands.<br />
<code>maas</code> is renamed to <code>maas-region-admin</code>. <code>maas-cli</code> is now just <code>maas</code>.</p>

<p>(released in Ubuntu 13.10)</p>
<h3 id="major-new-features">Major new features<a class="anchor" href="#major-new-features"></a></h3>
<p>LLDP collection.<br />
MAAS now collects LLDP data on each node during its commissioning cycle. The router to which the node is connected will have its MAC address parsed out of the data and made available for using as a placement constraint (passing connected_to or not_connected_to to the acquire() API call), or you can define tags using expressions such as <code>//lldp:chassis/lldp:id[@type="mac"]/text() = "20:4e:7f:94:2e:10"</code> which would tag nodes with a router using that MAC address.</p>
<p>New faster installer for nodes.<br />
MAAS will now make use of the new <a href="https://launchpad.net/curtin">Curtin</a> installer which is much quicker than the old Debian Installer process. Typically an installation now takes a couple of minutes instead of upwards of 10 minutes. To have a node use the faster installer, add the <code>use-fastpath-installer</code> tag to it, or click the "Use the fast installer" button on the node page.</p>
<p>More extensible templates for DHCP, power control, PXE and DNS.<br />
Templates supplied for these activities are now all in their own template file that is customisable by the user. The files now generally live under /etc/maas/ rather than embedded in the code tree itself.</p>
<h3 id="minor-feature-changes">Minor feature changes<a class="anchor" href="#minor-feature-changes"></a></h3>
<p>Reworked ephemeral downloading<br />
While there is no end-user visible change, the ephemeral image download process is now driven by a data stream published by Canonical at <a href="http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/streams">http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/streams</a>. In the future this will allow end users to use their own customised images by creating their own stream. The configuration for this is now also part of <code>pserv.yaml</code>, obsoleting the maas_import_ephemerals configuration file. The config will be auto-migrated on the first run of the <code>maas-import-ephemerals</code> script.</p>
<p>Improved maas-cli support<br />
Users can now manage their SSH keys and API credentials via the maas-cli tool.</p>
<p>Django 1.5<br />
MAAS is updated to work with Django 1.5</p>
<p>HP Moonshot Systems support.<br />
MAAS can now manage HP Moonshot Systems as any other hardware. However, in order for MAAS to power manage these systems, it requires the user to manually specify the iLO credentials before the enlistment process begins. This can be done in the <code>maas_moonshot_autodetect.py</code> template under <code>/etc/maas/templates/commissioning-user-data/snippets/</code>.</p>
