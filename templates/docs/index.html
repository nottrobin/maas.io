    <h1 id="maas-metal-as-a-service">Documentation</h1>
    <p>This is the documentation for Canonical’s MAAS dynamic server provisioning system. If you aren’t sure what that is, you should probably skip everything else and head straight to the Orientation section.</p>
    <p>The documentation is maintained with MAAS source code in the top-level docs/ directory. The correct version of the docs should be installed with MAAS on your server, and you can always find the latest documentation at http://maas.ubuntu.com.</p>
    <p>If you want to improve the docs or think you have spotted an error, we really want to hear about it. Please file a bug report or contact us directly. In addition you can talk to us on the #maas Freenode IRC channel.</p>
