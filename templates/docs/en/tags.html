<h1 id="making-use-of-tags">Making use of Tags<a class="anchor" href="#making-use-of-tags"></a></h1>
<p>MAAS implements a system of tags based on the physical properties of the
nodes. The idea behind this is that you can use the tags to identify
nodes with particular abilities which may be useful when it comes to
deploying services.</p>
<p>A real world example of this might be to identify nodes which have fast
GPUs installed, if you were planning on deploying software which used
CUDA or OpenCL which would make use of this hardware.</p>
<h2 id="tag-definitions">Tag definitions<a class="anchor" href="#tag-definitions"></a></h2>
<p>Before we can create a tag we need to know how we will select which
nodes it gets applied to. MAAS collects hardware information from the
nodes using the <a href="http://ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter">“lshw”
utility</a> to return detailed
information in XML format. The definitions used in creating a tag are
then constructed using XPath expressions. If you are unfamiliar with
XPath expressions, it is well worth checking out the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_syntax.asp">w3schools
documentation</a>. For the
lshw XML, we will just check all the available nodes for some
properties. In our example case, we might want to find GPUs with a clock
speed of over 1GHz. In this case, the relevant XML node from the output
will be labelled “display” and does have a property called clock, so it
will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">    //node[@id=&quot;display&quot;]/clock &gt; 1000000000
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a definition, we can go ahead and create a tag.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-tag">Creating a tag<a class="anchor" href="#creating-a-tag"></a></h2>
<p>Once we have sorted out what definition we will be using, creating the
tag is easy using the <code>maas</code> command. You will need
to <a href="maascli.html#api-key">be logged in to the API first</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas maas tags new name='gpu' \
      comment='GPU with clock speed &gt;1GHz for running CUDA type operations.' \
      definition='//node[@id=&quot;display&quot;]/clock &gt; 1000000000'
</code></pre>

<p>The comment is really for your benefit. It pays to keep the actual tag
name short and to the point as you will be using it frequently in
commands, but it may subsequently be hard to work out what exactly was
the difference between tags like “gpu” and “fastgpu” unless you have a
good comment. Something which explains the definition in plain language
is always a good idea!</p>
<p>To check which nodes this tag applies to we can use the tag command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas maas tag nodes gpu
</code></pre>

<p>The process of updating the tags does take some time - not a lot of
time, but if nothing shows up straight away, try running the command
again after a minute or so.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-tag">Using the tag<a class="anchor" href="#using-the-tag"></a></h2>
<p>You can use the tag in the web interface to discover applicable nodes,
but the real significance of it is when using juju to deploy services.
Tags can be used with juju constraints to make sure that a particular
service only gets deployed on hardware with the tag you have created.</p>
<p>Example: To use the ‘gpu’ tag we created to run a service called ‘cuda’
we would use:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">juju deploy --constraints tags=gpu cuda
</code></pre>

<p>You could list several tags if required, and mix in other juju
constraints if needed:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">juju deploy --constraints &quot;mem=1024 tags=gpu,intel&quot; cuda
</code></pre>

<h2 id="manually-assigning-tags">Manually assigning tags<a class="anchor" href="#manually-assigning-tags"></a></h2>
<p>MAAS supports the creation of arbitrary tags which don’t depend on XPath
definitions (“nodes which make a lot of noise” perhaps). If a tag is
created without specifying the definition parameter then it will simply
be ignored by tag refresh mechanism, but the MAAS administrator will be
able to manually add and remove the tag from specific nodes.</p>
<p>In this example we are assuming you are using the ‘maas’ profile and you
want to create a tag called ‘my_tag’:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas maas tags new name='my_tag' comment='nodes which go ping'
maas maas tag update-nodes my_tag add=&quot;&lt;system_id&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The first line creates a new tag but omits the definition, so no nodes
are automatically added to it. The second line applies that tag to a
specific node referenced by its system id property.</p>
<p>You can easily remove a tag from a particular node, or indeed add and
remove them at the same time:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas maas tag update-nodes my_tag add=&lt;system_id_1&gt; \
     add=&lt;system_id_2&gt; add=&lt;system_id_3&gt; remove=&lt;system_id_4&gt;

As the rule is that tags without a definition are ignored when rebuilds
are done, it is also possible to create a normal tag with a definition,
and then subsequently edit it to remove the definition. From this point
the tag behaves as if you had manually created it, but it still retains
all the existing associations it has with nodes. This is particularly
useful if you have some hardware which is conceptually similar but
doesn’t easily fit within a single tag definition:

```bash
maas maas tag new name='my_tag' comment='nodes I like ' \
       definition='contains(//node[@id=network]/vendor, &quot;Intel&quot;)'
maas maas tag update my_tag definition=''
maas mass tag update-nodes my_tag add=&lt;system_id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p class="note"><strong> Note</strong>: If you add and remove the same node in one operation, it ends up having
the tag removed (even if the tag was in place before the operation).</p>
