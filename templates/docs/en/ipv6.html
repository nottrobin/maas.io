<p>Note</p>
<p>This feature is available in MAAS versions 1.7 and above, starting with
lp:maas revision 2992. If you’re writing a client application that makes
use of this feature, you can query the region-server API for the
<code class="docutils literal">ipv6-deployment-ubuntu</code>
<a href="capabilities.html#cap-ipv6-deployment-ubuntu"><em>capability</em></a>.</p>
<p>MAAS has limited IPv6 support for networking nodes. It works much like
IPv4 support, but with a number of limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nodes still boot, register, and install using the IPv4 network.</li>
<li>IPv6 addresses are only configured when using the default Ubuntu
    installer.</li>
<li>Most BMCs can only be controlled (e.g. to power nodes on/off) using
    IPv4.</li>
<li>MAAS still uses IPv4 for its internal operation, installing nodes,
    etc.</li>
<li>For now, MAAS only supports IPv6 on networks where it also manages
    IPv4 DHCP.</li>
<li>A network interface on a node can only be on one IPv6 subnet.</li>
<li>A network interface on a cluster controller can manage only one IPv6
    subnet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The web user interface and REST API can be accessed in the same way on
both IPv4 and IPv6. To use an IPv6 address as the hostname in a URL, in
your browser or elsewhere, surround it with square brackets. For
example, on the local machine (<code class="docutils literal">::1</code>, the IPv6
equivalent of <code class="docutils literal">localhost</code>) you might request:</p>
<pre><code>http://[::1]/MAAS/
</code></pre>
<p>If your MAAS server has a DNS hostname that resolves to both IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses, your browser may already be accessing the UI through
IPv6 without you noticing.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-ipv6">Enabling IPv6<a href="#enabling-ipv6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a><a class="anchor" href="#enabling-ipv6"></a></h2>
<p>You enable IPv6 networking in the same way that you enable IPv4
networking: configure a separate cluster interface for your IPv6 subnet,
in addition to the one you need for your IPv4 subnet. The IPv6 cluster
interface must define a static address range. Provided that you already
have a functioning IPv6 network, that’s all there is to it. The
following sections will go into more detail about what is supported,
what is needed, and what to do if you don’t yet have a functioning IPv6
network.</p>
<p>An IPv6 cluster interface can use the same network interface on the
cluster controller as an existing IPv4 network interface. It just
defines a different subnet, with IPv6 addressing. A node that’s
connected to the IPv4 subnet will also be connected to the IPv6 subnet
on the same network segment.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-your-ipv6-subnet">Configuring your IPv6 subnet<a href="#configuring-your-ipv6-subnet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a><a class="anchor" href="#configuring-your-ipv6-subnet"></a></h3>
<p>When you configure your IPv6 cluster interface, be sure to define a
static IP address range. Deployed nodes on the subnet will get static
addresses in this range.</p>
<p>IPv6 networks are normally 64 bits wide, so you can be generous with the
ranges’ sizes. It also means that you can leave the netmask field blank.</p>
<p>(There are no broadcast addresses in IPv6, so leave the broadcast
address field blank as well.)</p>
<p>You may want MAAS to manage DHCP and DNS, but it’s not required. In fact
nodes do not need a DHCP server at all for IPv6; MAAS configures static
IPv6 addresses on the node’s network interfaces while deploying it. A
DHCPv6 server can provide addresses for containers or virtual machines
running on the nodes, as well as devices on the network that are not
managed by MAAS, but it is not needed for the nodes themselves. MAAS
will not be aware of any addresses issued by DHCP, and does not
guarantee that they will stay unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="routing">Routing<a href="#routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a><a class="anchor" href="#routing"></a></h3>
<p>In IPv6, clients do not discover routes through DHCP. Routers make
themselves known on their networks by sending out <em>route
advertisements</em>. These <em>RAs</em> contain other configuration as well:
whether clients should statelessly configure their own unique IP
addresses based on their MAC addresses; whether they should request
stateless configuration from a DHCP server; and finally, whether they
should request a stateful IP address from a DHCP server. Since a network
interface can have any number of IPv6 addresses even on a single subnet,
several of these address assignment mechanisms can be combined.</p>
<p>However, when MAAS configures IPv6 networking on a node, it does not
rely on RAs. it statically configures your nodes’ default IPv6 route to
use the router that is configured on the cluster interface, so that the
nodes will know their default gateway. They do not need DHCP and will
not autoconfigure global addresses.</p>
<p>However, if you are planning to operate DHCPv6 clients as well, e.g. on
machines not managed by MAAS or on virtual machines hosted by MAAS
nodes, you may still want to have RAs configured to make those clients
obtain configuration over DHCP.</p>
<p>If you need RAs but your gateway does not send them, install and
configure <code class="docutils literal">radvd</code> somewhere on the network to
advertise its route.</p>

<p>Static IPv6 addresses are currently only configured on Ubuntu, when
installed using the “fast” installer. Other operating systems, or Ubuntu
with the classic Debian installer, will not have their IPv6 addresses
configured. The same applies when a user manually installs an operating
system on a node, or overwrites its networking configuration: the node
will no longer have its static IPv6 address configured, even if MAAS has
allocated it to the node.</p>
<p>However, as long as the address remains allocated to the node, you may
still configure its operating system to use that address. The node can
then use that address as if it had been configured by MAAS.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-ipv4">Disabling IPv4<a href="#disabling-ipv4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a><a class="anchor" href="#disabling-ipv4"></a></h2>
<p>For advanced users, there is an experimental capability to deploy nodes
with pure IPv6, with IPv4 networking disabled. To enable this on a node,
check the “Disable IPv4 when deployed” box on the node’s Edit page. The
process of managing and deploying the node will still largely work
through IPv4, but once deployed, the node will have IPv6 networking
only.</p>
<p>In practice nodes may not be functional without IPv4 networking. A few
things are known to be needed in any case:</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-maas-url">Configuring the MAAS URL<a href="#configuring-the-maas-url" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a><a class="anchor" href="#configuring-the-maas-url"></a></h3>
<p>The <em>maas-cluster-controller</em> package has a configuration item for the
URL where nodes and cluster controllers can reach the MAAS region API.</p>
<p>By default, this URL is set based on the region controller’s IPv4
address. To make it work for nodes that won’t have IP4, you must set the
MAAS URL to use a hostname instead of an IP address. The hostname must
resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and both on the cluster
controller and on the nodes.</p>
<p>To change this setting, run:</p>
<pre><code>dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller
</code></pre>
<p>It will prompt you for the URL, with its current setting as the initial
value.</p>
