<h2 id="manual-dhcp-configuration">Manual DHCP configuration<a class="anchor" href="#manual-dhcp-configuration"></a></h2>
<p>DHCP is needed in order for MAAS to boot and control nodes. However,
there are some circumstances under which you may not wish a cluster
controller to handle DHCP address assignments for the network. In these
instances, the existing DHCP server for the network will need its
configuration altered to allow MAAS to enlist and control nodes
automatically.</p>
<p class="note"><strong> Note</strong>: If you don’t let MAAS manage DHCP, then MAAS will not be able to
allocate its <a href="cluster-configuration.html#static-ip-address"><em>static IP addresses</em></a> to nodes.</p>
<p>At the very least the “filename” option should be set to “pxelinux.0”.</p>
<p>How to configure this depends on what software you use as a DHCP server.
If you are using the ISC DHCP server, for example, the configuration
entry might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">    subnet 192.168.122.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        filename &quot;pxelinux.0&quot;;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
        option broadcast-address 192.168.122.255;
        option domain-name-servers 192.168.122.136;
        range dynamic-bootp 192.168.122.5 192.168.122.135;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When doing this, leave the cluster controller’s interface in the
“unmanaged” state.</p>
<p>If your cluster controller is in charge of nodes on more than one
network through different network interfaces, there is an additional
complication. Without the DHCP server built into the cluster controller,
MAAS may not know which of the cluster controller’s IP addresses each
node should use for downloading its installer image. If you want to
support this situation, ensure that all of the nodes can reach all of
the cluster controller’s network addresses.</p>
<h2 id="ssl-support">SSL Support<a class="anchor" href="#ssl-support"></a></h2>
<p>If you want secure access to your MAAS web UI/API, you need to do a few
things. First, turn on SSL support in Apache:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo a2enmod ssl
</code></pre>

<p>Ensure that the Apache config file from
<code class="docutils literal">etc/maas/maas-http.conf</code> is included in
<code class="docutils literal">/etc/apache2/conf.d/</code>, then edit
<code class="docutils literal">/etc/maas/maas_local_settings.py</code> and change
DEFAULT_MAAS_URL so that it uses https instead of http.</p>
<p>Now, restart Apache:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you will be able to access the MAAS web server using https
but the default SSL certificate is insecure. Please generate your own
and then edit <code class="docutils literal">/etc/apache2/conf.d/maas-http.conf</code>
to set the location of the certificate.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-series-to-install">Choosing a series to install<a class="anchor" href="#choosing-a-series-to-install"></a></h2>
<p>You may have some specific reason to choose a particular version of
Ubuntu to install on your nodes, perhaps based around package
availability, hardware support or some other reason.</p>
<p>It is possible to choose a specific series from those available in a
number of ways.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-user-interface">From the user interface<a class="anchor" href="#from-the-user-interface"></a></h3>
<p>The web-based user interface makes it easy to select which Ubuntu series
you wish to install on an individual node. When either adding a node
manually, or on the node page when the node has been automatically
discovered but before it is accepted, there is a drop down menu to
select the version of Ubuntu you wish to install.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/series.png" /></p>
<p>The menu will always list all the currently available series according
to which boot images are available.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-">Using the <code>maas</code> command<a class="anchor" href="#using-the-"></a></h3>
<p>It is also possible to select a series using the maas command. This can
be done on a per node basis with:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas &lt;profile&gt; node update &lt;system_id&gt; distro_series=&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Where the string contains one of the valid, available distro series
(e.g. “trusty”) or is empty for the default value.</p>
<h3 id="altering-the-preseed-file">Altering the Preseed file<a class="anchor" href="#altering-the-preseed-file"></a></h3>
<p class="note"><strong> Warning</strong>: Do not try to alter the preseed files if you don’t have a good
understanding of what you are doing. Altering the installed version of
Ubuntu can prevent MAAS from working as intended, and may have security
and stability consequences.</p>
<p>When MAAS commissions a node it installs a version of Ubuntu. The
installation is performed using a ‘preseed’ file, which is effectively a
list of answers to the questions you would get were you to run the
installer manually. The preseed file used by MAAS is carefully made so
that the target node can be brought up and do all the jobs expected of
it. However, in exceptional circumstances, you may wish to alter the
pressed file to work around some issue. There are actually two preseed
files, stored here:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">    /etc/maas/preseeds/generic
    /etc/maas/preseeds/preseed-master
</code></pre>

<p>The generic file actually references the preseed-master file, and is
used to set conditional parameters based on the type of series and
architecture to install as well as to define the minimum set of install
packages and to tidy up the PXE boot process if that has been used for
the node. Unless you have a specific need to change where install
packages come from, you should not need to edit this file.</p>
<p>For the more usual sorts of things you may wish to change, you should
edit the preseed-master file. For example, depending on your network you
may wish to change the clock settings:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">    # Local clock (set to UTC and use ntp)
    d-i     clock-setup/utc boolean true
    d-i     clock-setup/ntp boolean true
    d-i     clock-setup/ntp-server  string ntp.ubuntu.com
</code></pre>

<p>Having consistent clocks is very important to the working of your MAAS
system overall. If your nodes however cannot freely access the Internet,
the supplied NTP server is not going to be very useful, and you may find
it better to run an ntp service on the MAAS controller and change the
ntp.ubuntu.com in the last line for a more appropriate server.</p>
<p>One thing you may wish to alter in the preseed file is the disk
partitioning. This is a simple recipe that creates a swap partition and
uses the rest of the disk for one large root filesystem:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight"> partman-auto/text/atomic_scheme ::

    500 10000 1000000 ext3
            $primary{ }
            $bootable{ }
            method{ format }
            format{ }
            use_filesystem{ }
            filesystem{ ext3 }
            mountpoint{ / } .

    64 512 300% linux-swap
            method{ swap }
            format{ } .
</code></pre>

<p>Here the root partition must be at least 500MB, and has effectively no
maximum size. The swap partition ranges from 64MB to 3 times the
system’s RAM. Adding <code>\$bootable{ }</code> to make the partition bootable, and
<code>\$primary{ }</code> marks it as the primary partition. The other specifiers
used are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>method{ format }</em></dt>
<dd>Used to make the partition be formatted. For swap partitions, change
it to “swap”. To create a new partition but do not format it, change
“format” to “keep” (such a partition can be used to reserve for
future use some disk space).</dd>
<dt><em>format{ }</em></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Also needed to make the partition be formatted.</dt>
<dt><em>use_filesystem{ }</em></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Specifies that the partition has a filesystem on it.</dt>
<dt><em>filesystem{ ext3 }</em></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Specifies the filesystem to put on the partition.</dt>
<dt><em>mountpoint{ / }</em></dt>
<dd>Where to mount the partition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note"><strong> Note</strong>: Future versions of MAAS are likely to replace this type of automatic
installation with a different installer.</p>
<h2 id="installing-additional-clusters">Installing additional clusters<a class="anchor" href="#installing-additional-clusters"></a></h2>
<p>In an environment comprising large numbers of nodes, it is likely that
you will want to organise the nodes on a more distributed basis. The
standard install of the MAAS region controller includes a cluster
controller, but it is possible to add additional cluster controllers to
the configuration, as shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/orientation_architecture-diagram.png" /></p>
<p>Each cluster controller will need to run on a separate Ubuntu server.
Installing and configuring the software is straightforward though:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install maas-cluster-controller
</code></pre>

<p>This meta-package will install all the basic requirements of the system.
However, you may also wish or need to run DHCP and/or DNS services, in
which case you should also specify these:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install maas-cluster-controller maas-dhcp maas-dns
</code></pre>

<h3 id="configuring-the-cluster-controller">Configuring the cluster controller<a href="#configuring-the-cluster-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a><a class="anchor" href="#configuring-the-cluster-controller"></a></h3>
<p>Once the packages are installed, the cluster controller needs to know
where to look for the region controller. This is achieved using dpkg to
configure the software:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/cluster-config.png" /></p>
<p>The configuration script should then bring up a screen where you can
enter the IP address of the region controller. Additionally, you will
need to import the distro image files locally for commissioning:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas maas node-groups import-boot-images
</code></pre>

<p>…and optionally set up the DHCP and DNS for the cluster by either:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>Using the web UI</em></dt>
<dd>Follow the instructions at <a href="cluster-configuration.html"><em>Cluster
Configuration</em></a> to use the web UI to set
up your cluster controller.</dd>
<dt><em>Using the command line client</em></dt>
<dd>First <a href="maascli.html#api-key"><em>logging in to the API</em></a> and then
<a href="maascli.html#cli-dhcp"><em>following this procedure</em></a></dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="client-side-dns-configuration">Client-side DNS configuration<a class="anchor" href="#client-side-dns-configuration"></a></h2>
<p>When using a third party tool such as <code class="docutils literal">juju</code> it will
need to be able to resolve the hostnames that the MAAS API returns to
it. In order for this to happen, <em>client-side DNS</em> must be configured to
point to MAAS’s DNS server. Generally speaking, this is a simple case of
adding the following line to the <code class="docutils literal">/etc/resolv.conf</code>
file on your client host:</p>
<pre><code class="no-higlhight">nameserver &lt;IP OF MAAS DNS HOST&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>replacing the \&lt;IP OF MAAS DNS HOST> with the actual IP address of the
host running the MAAS DNS server.</p>
<p>However, for hosts using the <code>resolvconf</code> package,
please read its documentation for more information.</p>
