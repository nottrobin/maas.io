<p class="note"><strong> Note</strong>: This feature is available in MAAS versions 1.5 and above.</p>
<p>MAAS allows you to use hardware enablement kernels when booting nodes
that require them.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-hardware-enablement-kernels?">What are hardware-enablement kernels?<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-hardware-enablement-kernels?"></a></h2>
<p>Brand new hardware gets released all the time. We want that hardware to
work well with Ubuntu and MAAS, even if it was released after the latest
release of MAAS or Ubuntu. Hardware Enablement (HWE) is all about
keeping pace with the new hardware.</p>
<p>Ubuntu’s solution to this is to offer newer kernels for older releases.
There are at least two kernels on offer for Ubuntu releases: the
“generic” kernel – i.e. the kernel released with the current series –
and the Hardware Enablement kernel, which is the most recent kernel
release.</p>
<p>There are separate HWE kernels for each release of Ubuntu, referred to
as <code class="docutils literal">hwe-&lt;release letter&gt;</code>. So, the 14.04 / Trusty
Tahr HWE kernel is called <code class="docutils literal">hwe-t</code>, the 12.10 /
Quantal Quetzal HWE kernel is called <code class="docutils literal">hwe-q</code> and so
on. This allows you to use newer kernels with older releases, for
example running Precise with a Saucy (hwe-s) kernel.</p>
<p>For more information see the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack">LTS Enablement
Stack</a> page on the
Ubuntu wiki.</p>
<h2 id="booting-hardware-enablement-kernels">Booting hardware-enablement kernels<a class="anchor" href="#booting-hardware-enablement-kernels"></a></h2>
<p>MAAS imports hardware-enablement kernels along with its generic boot
images, but as different “sub-architectures” to the default “generic”
one.</p>
<p>So, for example, a common server might have architecture and
sub-architecture of <code class="docutils literal">amd64/generic</code>, but some newer
system chassis which doesn’t become fully functional with the default
kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, for example, may require
<code class="docutils literal">amd64/hwe-t</code>.</p>
<p>The quickest way to make a node use a hardware-enablement kernel is by
using the MAAS command, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">maas &lt;profile-name&gt; node update &lt;system-id&gt; architecture=amd64/hwe-t
</code></pre>

<p>If you specify an architecture that doesn’t exist (e.g.
<code>amd64/hwe-zz</code>), the <code>maas</code>
command will return an error.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use HWE kernels from the MAAS web UI, by visiting
the Node’s page and clicking <code>Edit node</code>. Under the
Architecture field, you will be able to select any HWE kernels that have
been imported onto that node’s cluster controller.</p>
